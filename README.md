Keyboard Code Detector

This web application allows the user to press any key on the keyboard and a text box will pop up and tell the user what key they are pressing and the key code associated with it.

I used HTML for the creation of the parent and child elements, JavaScript for the creation of the new child elements as well as the script used to generate both the key name and code, and CSS for the basic styling and alignment of elements.

The biggest challenges with this project was trying to avoid depreciated attributes to keep my code clean... as far as .keyCode goes, not too sure how to work around that. It works on all browsers and has no bugs.
